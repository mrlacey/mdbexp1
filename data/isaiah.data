Chapter 40
|-PH||1,11|Chapter 40

    1“Comfort you, comfort my people,”
|-VN||5,6|1
      declares your God.

    2“Speak home to the heart of Jerusalem,
|-VN||5,6|2
      cry unto her
      that her time of sore service is over,
      her guilt is discharged;
      for her sins she has doubly atoned
      at the hand of the Lord.”

3Hark! Says a voice, “In the wilderness
|-VN||1,2|3
clear you a way for the Lord;
make you straight in the desert
a highway for our God.

4Let every valley be raised,
|-VN||1,2|4
every mountain and hill brought low;
let the steep rugged ground become level,
the rough rocky ridges a plain.

5Then the Lord will show forth his glory,
|-VN||1,2|5
and all fresh will see it together:
the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.”

6Hark! Says a voice, “Proclaim.”
|-VN||1,2|6
“What should I proclaim?” said I.
“Proclaim that all flesh is grass,
 all its grace as the flower of the field.

7The grass withers, the flower fades,
|-VN||1,2|7
when upon it the breath of the Lord has blown.

8Yea, the grass withers, the flower fades;
|-VN||1,2|8
but the word of our God will stand for ever.”

9Get you up to a mountain high,
|-VN||1,2|9
you who tell good tidings to Zion;
lift up your voice with strength,
you who bring good news to Jerusalem;
lift it up, be not afraid.
Say to the cities of Judah,
“Yonder comes your God.”

10See! The Lord is coming in might,
|-VN||1,3|10
with an arm that ensures his dominion.
Behold, his reward is with him,
his recompense is before him.

11He feeds his flock like a shepherd,
|-VN||1,3|11
he gathered it with his arm;
he carries the lambs in his bosom,
and those who give suck he leads.

12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?
|-VN||1,3|12
Who has ruled off the heavens with a span,
comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure,
and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance?

13Who has directed the mind of the Lord?
|-VN||1,3|13
And where is the counsellor who taught him?

14Whom did he ask for enlightenment?
|-VN||1,3|14
Who taught him the pathway of right,
or showed him the way of true insight?

15See! Nations are nothing but a drop on a bucket,
|-VN||1,3|15
they count but as dust on a balance;
he lifted the isles like a mote.

16Too small for the fires (of his altars) is Lebanon,
|-VN||1,3|16
too few are its breasts for an offering.

17All nations are nothing before him,
|-VN||1,3|17
he counts them but empty nothing.

18So to whom will you liken God,
|-VN||1,3|18
or what likeness set over against him?

19An imagine! A craftsman has cast it, a goldsmith has overlaid it with gold.
|-VN||1,3|19
